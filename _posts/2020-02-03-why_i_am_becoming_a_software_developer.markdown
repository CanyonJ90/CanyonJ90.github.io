Growing up in a small   town, exposure to technology was very limited. 
I never would have imagined how crucial of a role computers and technologies using software would become.
Software development gives me the oppertunity to create and improve upon almost anything. 
The ability to persue or effect nearly any field or subject through  software is why i am becoming a developer.
